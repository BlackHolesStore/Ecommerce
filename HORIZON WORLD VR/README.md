## 🌟 About This Project

**Pizza Express VR** is a fully-featured drone pizza delivery game built natively for Meta Horizon Worlds. Players grab pizza boxes from a shop, load them onto drones, and navigate through a city to delivery zones – but here's the catch: **tilt the pizza too much and it gets destroyed.**

### 🎯 Meta Start Competition 2025
